# Project: AirBnB Clone

## Description

The AirBnB Clone project is an educational initiative designed to replicate the core functionalities of the AirBnB platform. This project encompasses various aspects of web development, including backend, frontend, and database management. The primary objective is to understand and implement the key components of a full-stack web application, such as user authentication, property listings, booking systems, and reviews.

## Project Features

- User authentication and authorization
- Property listing management
- Booking and reservation system
- User reviews and ratings
- Command interpreter for managing the application via command line
- RESTful API for frontend-backend communication
- Web interface for user interaction

## Command Interpreter

The command interpreter is a key component of the AirBnB Clone project. It allows developers to interact with the application's data models and perform various operations such as creating, updating, deleting, and querying objects. The command interpreter is essential for managing the backend of the application and is used extensively during development and testing.

### How to Start the Command Interpreter

1. Ensure you are in the project directory.
2. Run the command interpreter script:
   ```bash
   ./console.py
   ```
   You will see a prompt indicating that the command interpreter is ready to accept commands.

### How to Use the Command Interpreter

The command interpreter supports a variety of commands. Below is a list of some basic commands and how to use them:

#### General Commands

- `help <command>`: Display help information for a specific command.
  ```sh
  (hbnb) help create
  ```

- `quit`: Exit the command interpreter.
  ```sh
  (hbnb) quit
  ```

- `EOF`: Exit the command interpreter using EOF (Ctrl+D).
  ```sh
  (hbnb) EOF
  ```

#### Object Management Commands

- `create <class_name>`: Create a new instance of a class.
  ```sh
  (hbnb) create User
  ```

- `show <class_name> <id>`: Show the details of an object by class name and ID.
  ```sh
  (hbnb) show User 1234-5678-9101
  ```

- `destroy <class_name> <id>`: Delete an object by class name and ID.
  ```sh
  (hbnb) destroy User 1234-5678-9101
  ```

- `all <class_name>`: Display all objects of a specific class.
  ```sh
  (hbnb) all User
  ```

- `update <class_name> <id> <attribute_name> <attribute_value>`: Update an attribute of an object.
  ```sh
  (hbnb) update User 1234-5678-9101 email "user@example.com"
  ```

## Examples

Here are some example sessions with the command interpreter:

### Example 1: Creating a User

```sh
(hbnb) create User
d56c6f8c-9653-41cd-b1a8-09536c8f5d51
```

### Example 2: Showing a User

```sh
(hbnb) show User d56c6f8c-9653-41cd-b1a8-09536c8f5d51
[User] (d56c6f8c-9653-41cd-b1a8-09536c8f5d51) {'id': 'd56c6f8c-9653-41cd-b1a8-09536c8f5d51', 'created_at': datetime.datetime(2024, 5, 18, 12, 34, 56, 789012), 'updated_at': datetime.datetime(2024, 5, 18, 12, 34, 56, 789012)}
```

### Example 3: Updating a User

```sh
(hbnb) update User d56c6f8c-9653-41cd-b1a8-09536c8f5d51 email "newemail@example.com"
(hbnb) show User d56c6f8c-9653-41cd-b1a8-09536c8f5d51
[User] (d56c6f8c-9653-41cd-b1a8-09536c8f5d51) {'id': 'd56c6f8c-9653-41cd-b1a8-09536c8f5d51', 'created_at': datetime.datetime(2024, 5, 18, 12, 34, 56, 789012), 'updated_at': datetime.datetime(2024, 5, 18, 12, 35, 56, 789012), 'email': 'newemail@example.com'}
```

### Example 4: Deleting a User

```sh
(hbnb) destroy User d56c6f8c-9653-41cd-b1a8-09536c8f5d51
(hbnb) show User d56c6f8c-9653-41cd-b1a8-09536c8f5d51
** no instance found **
```

## Conclusion

The AirBnB Clone project provides a comprehensive learning experience in full-stack web development, covering everything from backend logic and database management to frontend design and user interaction. The command interpreter is a vital tool for managing and interacting with the application's data, making it an indispensable part of the development process.
